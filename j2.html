<h2><i>lotus</i></h2>
<p class="ad" >
Lotus plants are adapted to grow in the flood plains of slow-moving rivers and delta areas. Stands of lotus drop hundreds of thousands of seeds every year to the bottom of the pond. While some sprout immediately, and most are eaten by wildlife, the remaining seeds can remain dormant for an extensive period of time as the pond silts in and dries out. During flood conditions, sediments containing these seeds are broken open, and the dormant seeds rehydrate and begin a new lotus colony. </p>
<h2><i>Foxglove</i></h2>
<p class="sd">

Foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) is a common garden plant that contains digitalis and other cardiac glycosides. These chemicals affect the heart. Foxglove is poisonous, although recorded poisonings from this plant are very rare.</p>
<h2><i>Daffodils</i></h2>
<p class="ad">
The English word "daffodil" appears to be derived from "asphodel", with which it was commonly compared. The species are native to meadows and woods in southern Europe and North Africa with a centre of diversity in the Western Mediterranean, particularly the Iberian peninsula. </p>
