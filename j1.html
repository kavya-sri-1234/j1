<h2><i>Water Lily</i></h2>
<p class="ad" >
 The fragrant water lily is an aquatic plant that is most easily recognized by its eye-catching, open bloom and uniquely-shaped leaves. It is a radially symmetrical flower displaying either white or pink petals. The flower looms above flat, heart-shaped, glossy green, floating leaves.</p>
<h2><i>Cherry Blossom</i></h2>
<p class="sd">
Its flowers are nearly pure white, tinged with the palest pink, especially near the stem. They bloom and usually fall within a week, before the leaves come out. Therefore, the trees look nearly white from top to bottom. The variety takes its name from the village of Somei (now part of Toshima in Tokyo). </p>
<h2><i>Lotus</i></h2>
<p class="ad">
Lotus plants are adapted to grow in the flood plains of slow-moving rivers and delta areas. Stands of lotus drop hundreds of thousands of seeds every year to the bottom of the pond. While some sprout immediately, and most are eaten by wildlife, the remaining seeds can remain dormant for an extensive period of time as the pond silts in and dries out. During flood conditions, sediments containing these seeds are broken open, and the dormant seeds rehydrate and begin a new lotus colony.</p>
